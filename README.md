### Who this lesson is for
Kids between he age of 11 - 15. This lesson is easily digestible for students of this age. Students do not need to  have previous coding knowledge before hand to teach this lesson. However if they have knowledge of the cli before hand or how to use a text editor that can be helpful.
### Objective
Learn how what an HTML page is used for and how to create the basic skeleton of a web page. Students will learn how to create the basics of a web page and a few html elements.

### Step One
Students will need to know how to create a directory, an html file, and css file.
//  creating a directory is as simple as creating a folder and creating an html file is as simple as creating a word document. 
//html gives a website structor you can think of it in 2 ways the bones and organs of your body or as the scaffold of a building. Css is like the clothes on the persons back. Js is the brains of the operation.
// we will call our files index.html and style.css

### Step Two
Students will start going step by step creating the basic structor of a page and why everything is there. We will then start using using the `<div>` and `<p>` tags and then I will let students search for html elements and let me know what they do.

`<h1><h2><h3><h4><h5><h6>`
`<a>`
`<b> <strong>`
`<i> <em> `
`<img>`
`<li> <ul> <ol>`

//my favorite html tag is `<marquee>`
